## *bch_in_C file*
This file contains mostly not changed C code from the site:
http://the-art-of-ecc.com

Mainly two BCH encoder and decoder using PGZ error location for the bch4836c program
and using the Berlekamp-Masset algorithm in Berlekamp-Masseyc program
This folder also contains a very basic makefile and the source files are stored in source folder.


## *bch_in_Cpp file*
This is the main file of this whole project.

It contains 4 programs that take inspiration from two earlier mentioned programs
but are written in C++ and are using Object-oriented programming ideas and many other better
written functions.
